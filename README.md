# Treasure Hunt Game in Python

This Python program implements a simple text-based Treasure Hunt game where the player enters the "Kingdom of Dragons" and must choose between two caves, one containing a friendly dragon with treasure and the other a hungry dragon that will devour them. The objective is to choose the right cave and win the game.

## How the Game Works

1. The player is presented with an introduction to the Kingdom of Dragons and two cave options.
2. The player is prompted to enter their choice: cave 1 or cave 2.
3. If the player chooses the correct cave (randomly determined to be either 1 or 2), they win and are rewarded with the dragon's treasure.
4. If the player chooses the wrong cave, they lose and face the hungry dragon.
5. After the game outcome is revealed, the player is given the option to play again.

## Usage

To play the game, simply run the Python script. Follow the on-screen instructions to choose a cave and see if you can outsmart the dragons.

## Features

- Randomly generated dragon caves to add an element of surprise.
- User-friendly interface with clear instructions.
- Option to play the game multiple times.

## How to Run

1. Make sure you have Python installed on your system.
2. Download the `treasure_hunt.py` file.
3. Open a terminal or command prompt.
4. Navigate to the directory where `treasure_hunt.py` is located.
5. Run the game by executing the command: `python treasure_hunt.py`.

Have fun playing and enjoy the adventure in the Kingdom of Dragons!
